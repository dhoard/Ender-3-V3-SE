# THIS PROJECT IS IN THE PROCESS OF A REDESIGN

## X-axis linear rail

### Parts list:

1 x MGN9H 350mm linear rail (preferably with z1 preset loading (common))
- a 300mm linear rail will work, but leaves no margin of error when installing
- an MGN12 rail will NOT work due to the carriage width (27mm)

2 x [MGN9 linear rail spacer blocks](https://github.com/dhoard/Ender-3-V3-SE/blob/main/x-axis-linear-rail/Ender%203%20V3%20SE%20MGN9%20linear%20rail%20spacer%20block.3mf)
- 50% cubic infill, .12mm layer height, 4 walls
- more can be used, but don't seem to be required

1 x [MGN9H carriage mount](https://github.com/dhoard/Ender-3-V3-SE/blob/main/x-axis-linear-rail/Ender%203%20V3%20SE%20MGN9H%20carriage%20mount.3mf)
 - 50% cubic infill, .12mm layer height, 4 walls 

1 x [X-axis endstop extension](https://github.com/dhoard/Ender-3-V3-SE/blob/main/x-axis-linear-rail/Ender%203%20V3%20SE%20x-axis%20endstop%20extension.3mf)
 - 50% cubic infill, .12mm layer height, 4 walls 

4 x  M3-0.5 x 8mm button head screws
 - MGN9H carriage mount to MGN9H carriage

2 x M3-0.5 x 10mm button head screws
 - MGN9 rail to x-axis extrusion

2 x M3 hammer head t-nuts

2 x MGN9 alignment tool
 - [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4976160](MGN9%20alignment%20tool)

2 x M5-0.8 hex head v-wheel bolts
- stock bolts for the top v-wheels

2 x M5-0.8 v-wheel spacers
- stock spacers for top v-wheels

### Instructions

4. Disassembly the printer tool head
5. Detach the x-axis belt
6. Remove the printer tool head x-axis gantry plate
7. Attach the MGN9 linear rail to the x-axis extrusion with the spacer blocks between the rail and extrusion
8. Attach the x-axis gantry plate to the MGN9H carriage mount using the v-wheel screws and spacers. (plate | spacer | carriage mount) (the x-axis gantry plate belt hooks may need to be bent.)
9. Reattach the x-axis belt
